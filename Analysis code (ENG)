This Python program retrieves Bitcoin price data for the past week from the CoinGecko API and visualizes it using Matplotlib. It provides a simple yet effective way to fetch cryptocurrency market data and plot it for analysis.

Key Components of the Program:
Library Imports:

requests: Used to make HTTP requests to the CoinGecko API to fetch Bitcoin price data.
matplotlib.pyplot: A popular Python plotting library used to visualize the data as a line graph.
datetime: Helps in converting the timestamp from the API into human-readable date and time formats.
API Request to CoinGecko:

The API endpoint "https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/bitcoin/market_chart" is used to retrieve the Bitcoin price in USD for the past 7 days.
The API parameters specify that the data will be in USD (vs_currency='usd') and for the last 7 days (days='7').
Data Processing:

After fetching the data from the API, it is converted from JSON format using response.json().
The prices are extracted from the data['prices'] field, which includes both timestamps (in milliseconds) and price values.
The timestamps are converted to human-readable dates using datetime.fromtimestamp(), and price values are stored for later plotting.
Plotting the Data:

The program uses matplotlib to generate a line plot of the Bitcoin price over time.
The plt.plot() function is used to plot the timestamps on the x-axis and the corresponding prices on the y-axis.
A title ('Bitcoin Price Over the Last Week'), x-axis label ('Date'), and y-axis label ('Price in USD') are added for clarity.
The x-axis labels are rotated by 45 degrees for better readability.
Finally, the grid and layout are adjusted to ensure the plot is clean and easy to interpret.
Visualization:

The plot displays Bitcoin's price fluctuations over the last 7 days, with data points marked on the line to show key points in the price movement.
The graph provides a visual summary of how the price has changed, helping users or analysts quickly assess trends.
Summary:
This program fetches real-time Bitcoin price data from the CoinGecko API for the past week and visualizes the price trends using a simple line chart. It demonstrates how to interact with a public API, handle JSON data, and create time-based plots. This can be used for quick analysis of cryptocurrency market trends, or as part of a larger financial data analysis project.
